# ICU Analysis

## Background
This repository contains a dataset downloaded from kaggle from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/icu-patients). <br>

The notebook 'ICU_analysis.ipynb' contains a rough analysis of the dataset above with 3 classification models using Logistic Regression, 
Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest <br>

Lastly, the environment file 'ds_env.yml' shows the package versions used for this project and, to avoid any discrepancies, create an environment with the file before running the notebook.
